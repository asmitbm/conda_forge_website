This prototype website is built with Docusaurus.

<!--truncate-->

We are experimenting with this framework for two reasons:

- Writing documentation about the conda-forge infrastructure _somewhere_ before we submit it to the official site.
- Seeing if Docusaurus could replace the current conda-forge website.

This blog post is just a demonstration of how this would look like.
